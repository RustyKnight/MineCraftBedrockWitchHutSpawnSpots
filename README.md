![MinecraftBedrock](https://img.shields.io/badge/MinecraftBedrock-1.19.30-orange)

## Description

Witch huts are hard coded structure spawns meaning they can spawn in only predefined locations. The witch hut is decorative, and the spawn spot is always on the same block position within the chunk. So placing the armor stand in the same chunk as the witch hut is adequate.

* Witches will spawn at floor level of the witch hut, this feature does not account for the y level, only the x,z location.
